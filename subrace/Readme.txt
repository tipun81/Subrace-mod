The mod adds subraces from the game Icewind Dale 2 to the Enhanced Edition games. Installation requires game versions 2.5+.

AASIMAR
Aasimar carry the blood of a celestial, the begotten offspring from the union of a mortal and a deity.  Aasimar are usually good-aligned and fight against evil in the world.  They typically have fair skin, golden eyes, and often a birthmark in the shape of the deity's holy symbol.  Aasimar are blessed with insight and personal magnetism and are typically paladins.

TIEFLING
The infernal counterpart to aasimar, tieflings are humans with a hint of the diabolical in their bloodline. Though their appearance is mostly human, they often have telltale signs that belie their ancestry. Tieflings usually have dusky skin and dark or reddish hair. Though many sport small horns, cat eyes, or other bizarre features, most tieflings try to hide their abnormalities from humans.

DROW
Dark elves, also known as drow, are the subterranean cousins of moon elves. Their black skin and pale hair are a curse for their allegiance with the spider goddess, Lolth. Drow societies are usually ruled by cruel priestesses of Lolth and their noble houses. Dark elves are known for their arrogance, cruelty, and penchant for civil war.

Advantages:
 +1 Constitution

Disadvantages:

STRONGHEART HALFLING
While the lightfoot halflings value the experience of travel and the sight of new lands and peoples, the strongheart halflings are a more organized, orderly, and industrious race.  Strongheart halflings often surprise those more familiar with their wandering lightfoot cousins with their confident and readily competitive nature.

Advantages:
 +1 Axe skill

Disadvantages:
 no

GHOSTWISE HALFLING
Ghostwise halflings are the feral, reclusive cousins of lightfoot and strongheart halflings. They are found most often in the southern forests of the Realms living in small communities. Ghostwise halflings are rarely seen in large cities, but occasionally set out to explore the world for reasons known only to them. Visitors to ghostwise settlements often report that the halflings have kinship so tight with their fellows that they can communicate without speaking.

 +5 Search traps (for thieves)
 Set trap 1/Day (for thieves)

Disadvantages:
 no

DEEP GNOME
Also known as svirfneblin, the deep gnomes of the Realms are a secretive, mysterious race. Found in the deepest caverns of the Underdark, the svirfneblin live in constant fear of slavery or destruction at the hands or dark elves, mind flayers, and duergar. Deep gnomes are legendary for their ability to handle stone and gems. They have brown or gray skin and gray or white hair.

GOLD DWARF
In a time when the dwarven race is in sad decline, the gold dwarves of the Realms received a divine gift from Moradin, the Soul Forger. The father of the dwarven gods granted the Thunder Blessing upon his people, resulting in a slow growth of the gold dwarf population. Though its effects may not be felt for decades, gold dwarves are already starting to re-establish themselves in the Realms as shrewd traders and proud, if somewhat haughty, warriors.

 +1 Charisma
 +2 dodge bonus against giants
 +1 +1 racial bonus to attack rolls against aberrations, the bizarre creatures that live in the Underdark

GRAY DWARF
Also known as duergar, the gray dwarves of the Forgotten Realms live even deeper underground than their shield dwarf and gold dwarf cousins. The duergar share little in common with other dwarves and practice slavery in their monstrous subterranean cities. Often motivated by greed and a thirst for power, gray dwarves are known throughout the Realms as devious, efficient warriors. Duergar almost always have gray hair and skin.

Advantages:
 +10 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, secret doors, stonework traps and new construction
