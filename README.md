AASIMAR
Aasimar carry the blood of a celestial, the begotten offspring from the union of a mortal and a deity.  Aasimar are usually good-aligned and fight against evil in the world.

TIEFLING
The infernal counterpart to aasimar, tieflings are humans with a hint of the diabolical in their bloodline.

STRONGHEART HALFLING
While the lightfoot halflings value the experience of travel and the sight of new lands and peoples, the strongheart halflings are a more organized, orderly, and industrious race.

Advantages:
 +1 Axe skill

Disadvantages:
 None

GHOSTWISE HALFLING
Ghostwise halflings are the feral, reclusive cousins of lightfoot and strongheart halflings. They are found most often in the southern forests of the Realms living in small communities.

DEEP GNOME
Also known as svirfneblin, the deep gnomes of the Realms are a secretive, mysterious race.

GOLD DWARF
In a time when the dwarven race is in sad decline, the gold dwarves of the Realms received a divine gift from Moradin, the Soul Forger. The father of the dwarven gods granted the Thunder Blessing upon his people, resulting in a slow growth of the gold dwarf population. Though its effects may not be felt for decades, gold dwarves are already starting to re-establish themselves in the Realms as shrewd traders and proud, if somewhat haughty, warriors.

GRAY DWARF
Also known as duergar, the gray dwarves of the Forgotten Realms live even deeper underground than their shield dwarf and gold dwarf cousins.
